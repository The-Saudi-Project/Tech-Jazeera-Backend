/**
 * File-upload middleware (Multer) → Cloudinary.
 *
 * These files are passports, visas, iqamas, medical records and contracts, so
 * two properties matter more than anything else here:
 *
 * 1. THE BYTES ARE NEVER PUBLIC. Uploads use `type: 'authenticated'`, which
 *    makes the ordinary `res.cloudinary.com/<cloud>/raw/upload/<id>` URL 404.
 *    The only way to read a file is a SIGNED url, minted per request by
 *    `signedDownloadUrl()` and used server-side only — the browser receives
 *    the bytes from our own authenticated endpoint and never sees a
 *    Cloudinary URL. (Before this, every upload sat on a public CDN URL that
 *    outlived the uploader's account entirely.)
 *
 * 2. WE ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO DELETE IT AGAIN. Everything is stored as
 *    `resource_type: 'raw'` — chosen explicitly, never 'auto'. 'auto' lets
 *    Cloudinary pick image-vs-raw per file, but multer-storage-cloudinary does
 *    not report which it picked, and a delete that guesses wrong returns
 *    `{ result: 'not found' }` WITHOUT throwing — so the file silently
 *    survives forever while the app reports success. Picking it ourselves
 *    removes the guess.
 *
 * 'raw' also stores bytes verbatim: no image pipeline, so a slightly malformed
 * PDF is still stored as the document the user actually has, instead of being
 * rejected mid-upload.
 *
 * 3. THE FILE IS WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE. The declared MIME type is written by the
 *    client and means nothing on its own — HTML labelled as a Word document was
 *    previously accepted and stored. Uploads are now buffered in memory, their
 *    leading bytes checked against the real format signature, and only then
 *    sent to storage.
 *
 * See docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md (C-1, C-2, H-1, M-1) for the findings this replaces.
