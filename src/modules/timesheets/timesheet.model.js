/**
 * Timesheet — one employee's weekly hours summary, submitted for approval
 * (P2-M3b, the deferred half of P2-M3 — see docs/P2-M3-notes.md and
 * docs/PHASE3-PLAN.md's decision to default to a single-level approval
 * rather than the multi-level signed flow originally scoped).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second place to enter hours: Attendance (P2-M3's
 * geofenced self-punch, or a staff mark) is already the one source of daily
 * hours. A Timesheet is a snapshot/summary of a week's worth of that data,
 * submitted by the worker as "this is correct" and then approved or
 * rejected by a supervisor — see timesheet.service.js for the aggregation.
 *
 * One document per employee per week (the unique index): resubmitting after
 * a Rejection updates the SAME document (fresh totals, back to Submitted),
 * it does not create a new one.
