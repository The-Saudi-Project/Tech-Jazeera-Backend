/**
 * Document — a titled file attached to an Employee or a Client, with
 * categories, an optional expiry date, and version history.
 *
 * Schema choices, justified:
 *  - `owner` uses a **dynamic reference** (`refPath: 'ownerType'`) so one
 *    collection serves both employee and client documents. ownerType tells
 *    Mongoose which model to populate against.
 *  - `versions` are EMBEDDED. A version is a stored file plus its metadata; it
 *    has no life outside its document and is only ever read together with it —
 *    the embed rule. The CURRENT version is simply the last element (versions
 *    are only ever appended, never reordered), so `versions.at(-1)` is current.
 *  - The stored file is referenced by `storage` + `fileName` (a disk UUID, or a
 *    Cloudinary public_id — see the field comments); `originalName` is kept
 *    only for display/download.
